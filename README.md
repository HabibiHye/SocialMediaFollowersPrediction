# SocialMediaFollowersPrediction

#Introduction
Social media platforms today are filled with content creators from various fields. While the number of followers might not matter to an average social media consumer, it holds significant value for content creators and businesses relying on social media for audience reach. Predicting the growth of social media followers is a valuable task for these individuals and organizations. In this project, I will walk you through the process of predicting your social media followers for the next month using machine learning with Python.

#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the increase in the number of followers on a social media platform. To accomplish this, we need a dataset that provides insights into the activities of people on your social media account, such as:

Monthly follower count
Relationship between views and followers
Unfollowers each month
Collecting such data can be challenging on common social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, as they do not readily provide follower-related data. For this project, we collected data from a social media platform like Medium, which is popular among content writers, bloggers, and researchers. You can adapt the same process to your dataset, whether obtained from Medium, Instagram, or any other social media application, to predict your social media followers.

Frameworks and Libraries
To carry out this project, we will utilize several Python frameworks and libraries. Here's a list of some possible frameworks and libraries you can use:

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. We use it to load and manipulate the dataset.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Matplotlib and Seaborn are libraries for creating data visualizations. They help us visualize follower counts and views over time.

Numpy: Numpy is used for numerical operations in Python. It can be useful for handling numerical data.

AutoTS: AutoTS is a library for time series forecasting. It aids in predicting future follower counts based on historical data.

Ensure you have installed the necessary libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, and AutoTS, to run this code successfully.
